## I specialize in ...

- Security-oriented projects  
- Reverse engineering and static binary analysis  
- Low-level and performance-critical code ( C, C++, C#, x64 ASM )  
- Network programming ( TCP/UDP, raw sockets, protocol design )  

Focused on building minimal, efficient solutions with full control over the stack. Strong preference for understanding systems at the lowest level.
